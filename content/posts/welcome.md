description: First post on my new minimal website built with markdown and GitHub Actions
---

This is my first post! This site is built with a simple markdown-based system that makes it incredibly easy to publish new content.

## How It Works

I can write posts in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) (or any markdown editor) and simply push them to GitHub. The site automatically rebuilds and deploys via GitHub Actions.

## The Workflow

1. Write in markdown
2. Save to `content/posts/`
3. `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`
4. Done! Site updates automatically

## Why This Approach?

- **Simple** - Just markdown files, no CMS
- **Fast** - Minimal build time, static output
- **Portable** - All content in plain text
- **Version controlled** - Full history via git

Looking forward to sharing more thoughts here!
